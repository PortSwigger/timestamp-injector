<p>Easily inject up-to-date timestamps into HTTP requests</p>

<p>If you have an API that needs a current or non-duplicate timestamp value to return properly, you can replace the old timestamp value with "UnixTimeS" to inject the current Epoch time into the call.</p>

<p>It will match:</p>

<blockquote><code>{"timestamp":UnixTimeS}</code></blockquote>

<p>And replace it with:</p>

<blockquote><code>{"timestamp":1730346030}</code></blockquote>

You can also define a time offset in the UI so that the injected timestamp occurs in either the future or past.

Other possible commands are:

<ul>
        <li>UnixTimeMS — Injects Epoch time in milliseconds</li>
        <li>TimeStamp — Injects a custom timestamp defined in the UI. I.E. yyyy-MM-dd</li>
        <li>URLTimeStamp — Same as previous command, but URL-encoded</li>
</ul>

<p>Custom timestamps are generated using the SimpleDateFormat Java class. Please see their documentation for a list of supported characters. You can include text as-is into your timestamp with single quotes:</p>

<blockquote><code>yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'</code></blockquote>

<p>Becomes:</p>

<blockquote><code>2024-10-31T04:14:02Z</code></blockquote>
